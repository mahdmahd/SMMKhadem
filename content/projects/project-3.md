## Overview
A neuroimaging study investigating how hippocampal subfield structure and shape differ across ApoE genotypes, using high-resolution MRI and computational geometry–based morphometric analysis.

## Project Details
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype—particularly the ε4 allele—is the strongest common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, yet the structural brain mechanisms through which ApoE4 confers risk remain incompletely understood. In this project, I tested the hypothesis that hippocampal morphology differs systematically across ApoE genotype groups even in the absence of overt dementia.

Using high-resolution hippocampal MRI data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), I stratified cognitively healthy individuals by ApoE genotype (ε4/ε4, ε3/ε4, and ε3/ε3). I performed hippocampal subfield segmentation using FreeSurfer and applied the HIPSTA framework, which uses tetrahedral mesh modeling and computational geometry, to quantify hippocampal thickness and shape beyond conventional volumetric measures.

Rather than focusing solely on global hippocampal volume, the analysis targeted localized shape and thickness differences that may reflect early vulnerability of specific hippocampal subfields. This approach allowed for spatially resolved comparisons across genotype groups and provided a more sensitive structural phenotype linked to genetic risk.

The project is currently in its final stages, with analyses complete and manuscript preparation underway. The results support the view that ApoE4-related neurodegenerative processes may manifest as subtle, regionally specific hippocampal shape alterations before measurable global atrophy occurs.
