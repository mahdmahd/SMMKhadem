## Overview
An M.D. thesis project investigating structural neuroimaging correlates of cognitive impairment in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), with a focus on extracting meaningful information from low-resolution routine clinical MRI data.



## Project Details
Frontotemporal dementia is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder in which cognitive and behavioral deficits are often poorly captured by routine imaging reports. As part of my M.D. thesis, I studied whether structural patterns observable in standard hospital MRI scans could be meaningfully linked to neuropsychological performance in patients with FTD.

I analyzed 1.5T, low-resolution 2D clinical MRI scans obtained from Firoozgar and Rasoul Akram Hospitals and related regional brain findings to neuropsychological test scores, including MMSE, MoCA, and their subdomains. Because the available imaging data were not optimized for research use, I applied slice-to-volume reconstruction using the Slice-to-Volume Reconstruction Toolkit (SVRTK) to generate higher-quality volumetric representations suitable for downstream analysis.

I independently learned, implemented, and optimized neuroimaging pipelines using FreeSurfer and SPM, including segmentation, cortical and subcortical analysis, and statistical modeling. As the project progressed, I refined the original hypotheses based on data quality and preliminary results and proposed additional analyses to strengthen interpretability and robustness.

A key component of the work was integrating imaging findings with cognitive data. I routinely reviewed primary neurodegeneration and neuroanatomy literature to interpret associations between regional brain changes and specific MMSE and MoCA sub-scores, rather than relying solely on global cognitive scores.

I presented and defended this work in my thesis, “Evaluation of Neuroimaging Findings and Neuropsychological Test Data in Frontotemporal Dementia Patients in Firoozgar and Rasoul-Akram Hospitals”, receiving a final grade of 90%.

Following the thesis defense, I extended the project by improving slice-to-volume reconstruction and segmentation of 2D clinical MRIs using SynthSeg, a generative AI–based framework capable of handling heterogeneous contrasts and resolutions. This continuation reflects my broader research position: understanding neurodegenerative disease mechanisms should not rely exclusively on high-resolution research scans, but must also leverage the vast and underused body of routine hospital imaging data.
