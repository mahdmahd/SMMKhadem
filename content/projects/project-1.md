## Overview
A Neuroimaging Project investigating the relationship between brain imaging patterns and cognitive test performance in frontotemporal dementia patients using advanced neuroimaging analysis techniques.

## Project Details
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects thinking, behavior, and language. Understanding which brain changes correlate with specific cognitive deficits is crucial for diagnosis and monitoring disease progression. The challenge? Clinical MRI scans often have lower resolution, and connecting structural brain changes to specific cognitive symptoms requires sophisticated analysis pipelines and careful interpretation.
This was my M.D. thesis project, where I dove deep into the neuroimaging world to explore these connections. I collected clinical MRI scans from FTD patients at Firoozgar and Rasoul Akram Hospitals, along with their neuropsychological test scores (MoCA, MMSE, and various subdomains). The scans were 2D 1.5T clinical images – not the highest resolution you could ask for – so I used SVRTK (Slice-to-Volume Reconstruction Toolkit) to reconstruct higher-quality 3D volumes from them.
Then came the real work: learning, troubleshooting, and optimizing several complex neuroimaging analysis pipelines. I used FreeSurfer and SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) for segmentation and statistical analysis, figuring out the quirks and optimal settings for each tool. This wasn't just running pre-set analyses – I independently led the project, refined my hypotheses as patterns emerged in the data, and proposed additional analyses to dig deeper into the findings.
Throughout the project, I immersed myself in the primary literature to make sense of what I was seeing. I worked to identify which specific brain regions might underlie particular MMSE and MoCA sub-scores, connecting the dots between structural changes and cognitive symptoms.
I presented and defended my thesis, "Evaluation of Neuroimaging Findings and Neuropsychological Test Data in Frontotemporal Dementia Patients in Firoozgar and Rasoul-Akram Hospitals," to a panel of supervisors and professors. The defense went well, and I received a grade of 90% – a validation of months of learning, analysis, and scientific detective work. This project gave me hands-on experience with clinical neuroimaging data, advanced analysis pipelines, and the iterative process of hypothesis-driven research, all while contributing to our understanding of how FTD affects the brain!
