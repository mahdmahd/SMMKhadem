## Overview
An ongoing research effort to improve brain MRI reconstruction techniques, enabling large-scale neurodegeneration studies using routine clinical imaging data rather than relying solely on high-resolution research scans.

## Project Details
Here's the thing about neurodegenerative disease research: we have access to tons of clinical MRI scans from hospitals – images taken during routine patient care – but they're often lower resolution and less standardized than the fancy research-grade scans. Most studies ignore this treasure trove of data and stick with high-resolution research MRIs. But what if we could unlock the potential of all that clinical data? That's exactly what I set out to do!
After successfully defending my M.D. thesis, I wasn't quite done with the neuroimaging world. I kept pushing forward with this work, focusing on improving the slice-to-volume reconstruction techniques I'd been using. The key innovation? Incorporating SynthSeg, a really clever generative AI-based framework that can segment MRIs regardless of their contrast or resolution. Unlike traditional segmentation tools that are picky about image quality, SynthSeg is remarkably robust.
My working hypothesis drives this whole effort: if we want to truly understand neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, we shouldn't limit ourselves to the relatively small number of high-resolution research MRIs out there. Instead, we should be exploiting the massive volumes of routine hospital imaging data that already exist. These clinical scans represent real-world patient populations, diverse scanning protocols, and longitudinal follow-up data that you just can't get easily in traditional research settings.
By combining improved slice-to-volume reconstruction with SynthSeg's flexible segmentation capabilities, I'm working to make these lower-quality clinical scans analyzable at scale. This could potentially transform how we study neurodegeneration – moving from small, highly controlled studies to large-scale analyses that better represent the full spectrum of disease. It's ongoing work, but the goal is to bridge the gap between clinical reality and research potential!
