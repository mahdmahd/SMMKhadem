## Overview
A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examining how metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) affects serum uric acid over time, and how these changes relate to renal function and visceral adiposity.



## Project Details
Hyperuricemia is common in obesity and is closely linked to insulin resistance, visceral fat accumulation, and impaired renal urate excretion. While metabolic and bariatric surgery is known to improve multiple metabolic outcomes, its longitudinal effects on serum uric acid—and the mechanisms underlying these changes—had not been comprehensively synthesized.

In this project, I conducted a PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 studies encompassing 9,468 patients to quantify temporal changes in serum uric acid following bariatric surgery and to examine their associations with renal function markers (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) and visceral adiposity (waist circumference).

Using random-effects models and meta-regression, I showed that serum uric acid exhibits a brief, non-significant rise in the immediate postoperative period, followed by a sustained and clinically meaningful reduction lasting up to four years, with the greatest decline occurring at 12 months. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass produced larger urate reductions than sleeve gastrectomy.

Meta-regression analyses revealed that postoperative serum uric acid levels were positively associated with creatinine, waist circumference, and body mass index, but not with blood urea nitrogen. These findings suggest that urate reduction after surgery is driven primarily by improvements in renal handling of uric acid and reductions in visceral adiposity rather than nonspecific changes in nitrogen metabolism.

Sensitivity analyses, publication bias assessment, and multiple robustness checks confirmed the stability of the results. This work clarifies the metabolic and renal pathways through which bariatric surgery improves hyperuricemia and supports the consideration of uric acid and kidney-related outcomes when selecting surgical strategies for high-risk patients.
