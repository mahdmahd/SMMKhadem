## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m a medical doctor and data analyst based in Tehran, Iran. I work at the intersection of **clinical medicine and data science**, focused on applying **AI** (machine learning, computer vision, NLP/LLMs, predictive modeling, and explainable AI) to improve decision-making and patient outcomes.

## 🤓 My Story

My path into medical data science started during my **M.D. thesis** at **Iran University of Medical Sciences**, where I studied neuroimaging findings in hospital MRI scans of patients with **frontotemporal dementia (FTD)** and related them to neuropsychological test scores (e.g., **MoCA** and **MMSE** and their subdomains). I worked with routine **1.5T low-resolution 2D clinical MRI data**, used slice-to-volume reconstruction methods, and built analysis pipelines using **FreeSurfer** and **SPM**. That experience taught me how to handle messy real-world medical data and turn it into evidence.

After graduating, I began working as a full-time physician in Tehran. Over time, I realized I genuinely enjoy **mathematics and statistics**, especially when I can apply them to real clinical problems using large datasets.

That led me to the **Minimally Invasive Surgery Research Center**, where I work as a data analyst and researcher under the supervision of **Dr. Mohammad Kermansaravi** and **Dr. Shahab Shahabi Shahmiri**. My work focuses on bariatric and metabolic surgery projects.

More recently, I also work as a **certified physician at Saman Insurance Company**, where I help improve medical-record workflows and explore AI use cases for claims assessment and fraud detection.
